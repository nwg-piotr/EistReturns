# EistReturns
Arcade-puzzle game

I had written this game back in 1992 for 8-bit Atari computers, 
and then given it the 2nd life a year ago on [Android devices](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.nwg.dev.eist).
This project is my sandbox to learn some JavaFX. Come and join if you liked some of the previous 
versions.

Installation
===============

**Arch / Arch-based Linux**

Please install the **eist-returns** package from the AUR. Also the PKGBUILD file in the 
[arch](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/EistReturns/tree/master/arch) directory is always up to date. 

Two separate shortcuts will be created: `Eist returns` for the game, and `Eist Editor` for the Level Editor.

To launch from the command, line just type `eist-returns` for the game, and `eist-returns -E | --edit` for the editor.

**Windows**

Download [eist-returns.exe](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/EistReturns/raw/master/windows/eist-returns.exe) file,
move anywhere, double click to run. If your computer has no Java Runtime Environment installed, 
you’ll be asked to download and install it from Oracle.
